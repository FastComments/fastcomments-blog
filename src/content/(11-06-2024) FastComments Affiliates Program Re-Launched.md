### What's New

FastComments now has a completely self-hosted affiliate program to improve conversion rates and reliability.

### Previous Provider

FastComments previously had an affiliate program through a provider called Rewardful. We began to be concerned about the conversion
rates through this program, and realized that ad blockers were impacting this integration.

Obviously this is a big issue, because most people use an ad blocker nowadays.

According to Rewardful, the program was properly working, but to make it work we could pay them more money. It was not unaffordable, but
we found the way they dealt with this problem and did not include the features necessary to make it work on all tiers of their platform
to be unacceptable. So, we quickly cancelled this partnership. Any FastComments customer data that was in Rewardful should now be deleted
at our request.

### The New Dashboard

When you view the affiliates dashboard for the first time you will see this:

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="images/affiliates-dashboard.png" alt="Affiliates Dashboard" title="Affiliates Dashboard" />
</div>

Clicking Create Affiliate Link will take you through the flow of creating your link and specifying your PayPal email for payouts.

### Impact to Existing Affiliates

Existing affiliates have already been migrated to the new system. If you had an account, you can view your affiliate stats in the
[affiliates dashboard](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/affiliates). Payouts have been resumed on the normal schedule.

### Benefits of Running it Ourselves

Now that we run the affiliate program on our own tech stack we don't have to worry about ad blockers or other issues.

We can also provide much more detailed stats around conversions. We can also customize this reporting experience over time without being beholden
to another provider.

### Documentation

[You can find the full documentation here](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-affiliates.html)

### In Conclusion

Like all major releases, we're glad that we could take the time to optimize, test, and properly release this. Let us know
below if you discover any issues.

Cheers!
