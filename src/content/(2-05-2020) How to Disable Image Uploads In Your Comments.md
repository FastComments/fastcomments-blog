# [postlink]How to Disable Image Uploads In Your Comments[/postlink]

With FastComments you can disable image uploads in the comment section of your website for either the entire site or just a particular page.

{{#isPost}}
To do so, go to <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/customize-widget" target="_blank">Customize</a> in the dashboard and add a customization rule.

Enabling the setting looks like this:

<img 
    src="images/fc-disable-image-uploads.png"
    alt="Disable Image Uploads"
    title="Disable Image Uploads"
    class='lozad' />

... and hit save.
On this page you must define your domain if it's not already pre-filled. Leave URL ID blank to apply the rule to your whole site.

This page has image uploads disabled as an example.
