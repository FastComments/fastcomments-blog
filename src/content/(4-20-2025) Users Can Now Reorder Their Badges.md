### What's New
A long-standing ask for power users of FastComments is that they could re-order their badges. Users can be automatically awarded badges, and some sites have many and many different types. When showing 20 different badges on each
comment, with some being image badges and some being text, showing them in the awarded order is not always desirable.

Now, by hovering over your account name in the top right of your dashboard and selecting `Manage Badges`, you can select which badges are active as well as re-order them. New badges will still be added onto the end.

### In The Future

In the future we will be revamping the user profile UI, and the new reorder component will replace the existing "Select Badges to Show" UI in profiles.

### In Conclusion

Like all major releases, we're glad that we could take the time to optimize, test, and properly release this feature. Let us know
below if you discover any issues.

Cheers!
