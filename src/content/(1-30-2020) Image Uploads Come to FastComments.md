# [postlink]Image Uploads Come to FastComments[/postlink]

{{#unless isPost}}
A picture is worth a thousand blog posts, right?
{{/unless}}

{{#isPost}}
Just as the title says - there is now a little image icon in the comment area of any FastComments widget. Upon clicking this you can insert
an image into your comment.

Uploaded images are resized for improved download performance.

External images can also be added, the syntax is [img]http://cat.png[/img].

Happy Commenting!
