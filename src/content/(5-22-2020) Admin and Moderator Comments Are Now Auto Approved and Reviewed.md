# [postlink]Admin and Moderator Comments Are Now Auto Approved and Reviewed[/postlink]

A minor announcement - but welcome to many!

{{#isPost}}

Previously, if auto approval was off then comments made by administrators or moderators would still require approval. Additionally, they would be marked "Not Reviewed".

With today's release all moderator and administrator comments will be marked Approved and Reviewed.

Happy commenting.
