FastComments now supports blocking images based on their content.

Images uploaded to comment sections can now be automatically filtered based on different profanity levels. This gives you more control over what appears in your community's discussions.

You can choose from four different moderation levels:

- **Off**: No moderation (default)
- **Low**: Blocks explicit sexual and violence content
- **Medium**: Also blocks hate, harassment and self-harm content  
- **High**: Additionally blocks mild suggestive content

This feature works for all newly uploaded images across all comment sections on your site, providing consistent moderation without requiring manual review.

#### Documentation

You can find the docs here: [https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#image-content-moderation](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#image-content-moderation).

Happy Commenting!
