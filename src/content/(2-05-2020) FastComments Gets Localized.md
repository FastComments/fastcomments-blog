# [postlink]FastComments Gets Localized[/postlink]

Localization is no small step - and it's arrived at FastComments. The embeddable comment widget is now fully localized in English (en-us), Spanish (es-es), and French (fr-fr).

You'll notice that we haven't slowed down, either. Generally when most applications add localization support the bloat starts to set in. In our case the client-side script has actually decreased in size as we've done some housekeeping and other optimizations at the same time.

If you'd like FastComments translated in your language, or you've spotted a translation issue, <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/help">let us know</a>.
