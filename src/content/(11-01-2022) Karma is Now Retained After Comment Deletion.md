### What's New

This year we introduced user profiles, and with it user karma. Up until now, if a comment was deleted, the associated karma was lost. No longer!

Now if a user receives up votes, or down votes, that affect their karma, deleting said comment will not cause those changes to be lost.

### SSO

This change is extended to SSO users, who now have a new `karma` property exposed in the API.

### In Conclusion

We hope you've found this update helpful. Feel free to comment below with any questions.

Cheers!
