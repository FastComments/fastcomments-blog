### What's New

FastComments now supports Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) support, providing an additional layer of security for your account.

You can now secure your FastComments account using either SMS verification or authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or any TOTP-compatible application.

### How to Enable 2FA

There is a new "Two-Factor Authentication" button in the Account Details page. The direct link is https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/two-factor.


### Multiple Device Support

Understanding that users often work across multiple devices, FastComments allows you to register multiple authenticator apps on your account. This means you can have the authenticator set up on both your phone and tablet, etc, up to five authenticators.

### In Conclusion

Security is a top priority for FastComments, and we're committed to providing our users with the tools they need to keep their accounts safe. Two-Factor Authentication is now available to all users at no additional cost.

We thank our customers for their continued feedback and trust. We hope you continue to love FastComments.

Cheers!
