### What's New

FastComments now has React Native components that are at feature-parity with our VanillaJS widget.

We decided to call the library `fastcomments-react-native`. You can find the GitHub repository with the source code <a href="https://github.com/FastComments/fastcomments-react-native" target="_blank">here</a>.

The repository also contains example usage of the widget.

It's on NPM, which you can find <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastcomments-react-native" target="_blank">here</a>.

### How it Works

The way this new component works is that the React component is a wrapper around the existing FastComments widget.
 
This means if we add features to our existing components or fix bugs you'll still benefit right away!

### Development Time

The React Native widgets can be added to your application in just minutes with little development time required.

### SSO

All React Native libraries support SSO out of the box, and the SSO integration process is the same as the Vanilla JS components. The existing
backend code examples apply, as well.

### Custom Styling?

The React Native components can be styled using CSS via the Widget Customization UI, same as the web-based widgets.

### Alternatives

You could build your own UI around 

### In Conclusion

By releasing the `fastcomments-react-native` library, and future libraries, we hope that we can make it easier for developers to adopt FastComments while using modern development
methodologies.

Cheers!
