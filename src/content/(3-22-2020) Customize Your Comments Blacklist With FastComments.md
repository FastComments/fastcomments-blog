# [postlink]Customize Your Comments Blacklist With FastComments[/postlink]

For some, the default word blacklist is too restrictive or too open.

{{#isPost}}

The default word blacklist can now be edited, or completely changed. Simply go to Moderate Comments -> Edit Moderation Settings -> Edit Blacklist.

    title="Customize Blacklist"

The words in this list should be separated by commas - but you can use spaces or newlines if it makes it easier for you to read.

Any changes can be expected to take at most five minutes to update.
