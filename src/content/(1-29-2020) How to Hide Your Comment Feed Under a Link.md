# How to Hide Your Comment Feed Under a Link [postlink]

Don't want to show a comment feed at the end of your pages, but want to let users comment? We got you.

{{#isPost}}

## For Site Admins

In order to hide a comment feed for a given page, or URL, under a link like "Show 103 Comments", simply create a customization rule like so:

<img 
    data-src="images/hide-comments-under-link.png"
    alt="Hide Comments Under Link Setting"
    class='lozad' />

This page has the setting applied as well.
Happy commenting!
