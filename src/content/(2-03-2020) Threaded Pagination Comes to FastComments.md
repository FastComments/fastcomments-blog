# [postlink]Threaded Pagination Comes to FastComments[/postlink]

FastComments now supports pagination without collapsing content! Also, if you want to read a long thread quickly
FastComments has a "Load All Comments" button on long threads (like <a href="https://blog.fastcomments.com/(12-30-2019)-fastcomments-demo.html" target="_blank">here</a>).

This means that if you have hundreds of replies on a page we aren't going to bog down your site by loading them all up at once. One the user scrolls down to
your comment section, and reads past the 30 comments we load initially, they can click "Show Next 30 Comments" to quickly load the next set and continue reading.

It's also well optimized, as usual. If you're into that kind of thing read about it on our <a href="https://blog.winricklabs.com/(2-03-2020)-how-optimized-threaded-pagination-works.html" target="_blank">engineering blog</a>.

This requires no additional setup from you! Existing customers will get this feature.
Enjoy FastComments.
