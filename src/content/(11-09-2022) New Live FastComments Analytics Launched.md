### What's New

[FastComments Analytics](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/analytics) can now be used to provide a **live** report on users using
your platform or product.

A total number of users online is provided, as well as the ability to **sort pages by the number of users online**. You can now also sort pages
by the number of comments on each page.

You'll find these reports are accurate and fast, as we have put significant effort into ensuring they
perform as such so that FastComments can continue to live up to its name. :)

### How to Get It

All FastComments customers on all tiers now have access to the new live analytics numbers via the [FastComments Analytics page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/analytics).

### Metrics Accuracy

The live metrics (users online, users online per page) are reported without any delay. They do require a page refresh to see the latest number, but
that number is served without any caching or delay. The other metrics, like number of page loads or new comments per day, may be up to one minute
delayed.

### User Activity Icon Improvements

Along with this release we have improved the accuracy of the user activity icons displayed on each comment that shows if a user
is online and viewing that comment thread. Before, there may be some delay, or the icon may not always be accurate. This has been
improved with a complete rewrite of the user activity tracking system.

### Documentation

Updated analytics documentation can be found on [docs.fastcomments.com](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-analytics.html).

### In Conclusion

Like all major releases, we're glad that we could take the time to optimize, test, and properly release this feature. Let us know
below if you discover any issues.

Cheers!
