# [postlink]Close a Comment Thread With FastComments[/postlink]

Have a discussion you want to close? The option is here!

{{#isPost}}

FastComments is all about enabling discussion and giving users a voice. However, sometimes you have content that's no longer relevant, or you want to disable replies temporarily, you now can.

Simply go to the <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/customize-widget" target="_blank">customization page</a> and check the "Prevent new replies" option.

Note that you should define a URL, unless you want to disable commenting across your entire site.

<img 
    data-src="images/fc-mark-thread-readonly.png"
    alt="Location of option to toggle commenting"
    title="Location of option to toggle commenting"
    class='lozad' />
    
That's it! The change should be in effect within a couple minutes.
