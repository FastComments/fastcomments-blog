### What's New

Today a series of bugfixes have been released for image uploading and the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing mode.

1. Progress indication is now showed when uploading images.
2. Pasting images, like screenshots is now supported (WYSIWYG editor only).
3. When editing comments, the comment boxes are now properly sized to show all the images (WYSIWYG editor only).
4. When removing images, the comment box shrinks as expected (WYSIWYG editor only). 

### In Conclusion

Thanks to our patient customers who brought up some of these issues. We hope you
continue to enjoy working with FastComments.
