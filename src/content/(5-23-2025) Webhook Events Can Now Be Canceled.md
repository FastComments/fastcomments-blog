# [postlink]Webhook Events Can Now be Canceled[/postlink]

{{#unless isPost}}
Events in the webhook processing queue can be canceled so they no longer retry.
{{/unless}}

{{#isPost}}

### What's New

Previously, cancelling webhook events was done via a support ticket. They can instead now be canceled self-service by going to the
[logs page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/manage-data/webhooks/logs) and clicking the `x` next to the event. 

Additionally, the webhook logs UI has been made much faster.

### In Conclusion

We hope you found this update helpful and continue to enjoy working with FastComments.
