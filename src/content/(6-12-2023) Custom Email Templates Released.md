### What's New

With this update you can now customize emails sent from FastComments to your customers.

The new email customization features use the powerful EJS template language, supports custom CSS, HTML, and direct
access to the data provided to each email. Additionally, translations can be customized on a per-locale basis
so that every user gets readable emails in their language.

The platform also has some features to track and report on render errors to help you build
a reliable integration. Find out more in the documentation.

### How to Get It & Documentation

The new email template customization dashboard is available via [Customize -> Email Templates](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/customize-email-templates).

Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-email-templates.html).

### In Conclusion

Like all major releases, we're glad that we could take the time to optimize, test, and properly release this feature. Let us know
below if you discover any issues.

Cheers!
