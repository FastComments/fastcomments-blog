### What's New

Today a series of bugfixes have been released for the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing mode.

1. Pasting images, like screenshots is now supported.
2. Progress indication is now showed when uploading images.
3. When editing comments, the comment boxes are now properly sized to show all the images.
4. When removing images, the comment box shrinks as expected. 

These changes only apply to sites that use the WYSIWYG mode and not the default text-only editing mode.

### In Conclusion

Thanks to our patient customers who brought up some of these issues. We hope you
continue to enjoy working with FastComments.
