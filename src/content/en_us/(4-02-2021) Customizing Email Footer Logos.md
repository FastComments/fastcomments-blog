## Preface

When non-sso users interact with FastComments and they provide an email, we create an account for them. As part of this process,
we'll send them a welcome email and an email to verify their vote or comment.

The From Name and Email in those emails can be customized via the <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/configure-domains" target="_blank">domains page</a>.

## What's New

Now it's not just the From Name and Email that can be customized - you can also customize the logo in the footer of the email itself.

## What is the Footer Logo?

We can see that if we upload a picture of Harold, he will appear in the footer of our email:

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="images/fc-custom-footer-logo-harold.png" alt="Custom Footer Logo" title="Custom Footer Logo Demo" />
</div>

Normally, a small version of the FastComments logo displays, but we can override it.

## Different Logo Per Site

You can customize a different logo for each domain in your account, creating a more consistent experience for your users. Our
<a href="https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-multiple-sites.html#from-name-email-logo" target="_blank">multi-site documentation</a> has
been updated to reflect this.

## Impact to Existing Customers

If you're an existing customer using FastComments, your users will not experience any change in functionality unless you change the email
logos from the default.

## How do I get it?

Custom branding is currently available with the FastComments Pro and Enterprise plans.

## In Conclusion

Happy commenting!
