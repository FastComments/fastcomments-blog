### What's New

<div class="columns">
    <div class="left">
        <p>To kick off the new year, conversations have been enhanced with animated reactions through the Gif Picker.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right text-center">
        <img src="images/shiba-with-hat.gif" alt="Happy dog gif" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;" />
    </div>
</div>

### How to Use It

<p>If image uploads are enabled, a GIF icon will show up in the comment toolbar.</p>
<p>Clicking this will display a list of trending gifs. This list preloads a certain number of images and offers infinite scrolling.</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="images/gif-picker-button.png" alt="How to use" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;" />
</div>

### Gif Providers

Currently, the only integration FastComments supports is with Giphy.

### Gif Anonymization

We understand that a significant portion of our user base chooses FastComments due to privacy concerns.

All assets and API calls from Giphy are stripped of information such as cookies and your users' IP address.

### Gif Content Rating

The content rating of gifs can be adjusted to be anywhere from PG to R-rated, depending on your
audience. [Documentation for customizing the content rating is here.](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#gif-rating)

### Documentation

There is specific documentation for the gif picker. See here: https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-gifs.html

### In Conclusion

We've made a substantial investment to ensure the Gif picker and related functionalities are fast and do not hinder the
rest of the product.

Like the rest of FastComments, we hope you find this feature quick, enjoyable, and easy to use.

Cheers!
