# [postlink]Show Results Breakdown After Answering Questions[/postlink]  

{{#unless isPost}}  
FastComments now allows you to display an aggregated breakdown of all responses to users after they answer a rating or survey question.

### What's New  

When collecting feedback through Star ratings, NPS, Thumbs Up/Down, or Slider questions, you can now show users an aggregated results breakdown immediately after they respond.  

Previously, users would respond to a question and only see their selection highlighted. Now, with the new **Show Results Breakdown After Answering** setting, they can see how everyone else on that page responded.  

### What It Looks Like  

For **Star ratings**, the breakdown displays the average rating with partial-fill stars, a per-star distribution bar chart with percentages, and the total response count.  

For **NPS questions**, it shows the NPS score along with the percentages of Promoters, Passives, and Detractors using color-coded bars.  

For **Thumbs Up/Down**, users see the percentage division between thumbs up and thumbs down.  

For **Slider questions**, the average value and total response count are presented.  

Sub-questions each receive their own individual breakdown as well.  

### How to Enable It  

1. Go to the [Customize UI](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/customize-widget).  
2. Edit your customization rule (or create a new one).  
3. Under the question settings, check **Show Results Breakdown After Answering**.  
4. Save.  

That's it. The breakdown will be shown to users on that page after they submit their answer.  

### Performance  

The breakdown data is aggregated per page and cached server-side, so it does not add significant load. When a user submits a new answer, the cache is refreshed so the breakdown reflects the latest data immediately.  

### Dark Mode  

The breakdown fully supports dark mode. When your site employs a dark background, the bars, labels, and text colors adjust automatically.  

### In Conclusion  

This feature provides users with immediate social proof and context after answering, which can enhance engagement with your ratings and surveys. It works with all four question types and does not require any code changes to activate.  

We hope you enjoy this addition. Let us know below if you have any feedback!  

Cheers!
