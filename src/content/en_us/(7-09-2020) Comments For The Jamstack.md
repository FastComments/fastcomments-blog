# [postlink]Comments For The Jamstack[/postlink]

{{#unless isPost}}
What's old is new again. Pre-rendering and serving sites from a CDN is now referred to as the "JamStack" - but they don't have to be entirely static!

### <i class="circle">!</i> This Article Contains Technical Jargon

<a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">The Jamstack</a> is a method for creating a website that doesn't rely on a traditional web server. Instead, they are
hosted on servers we call a "CDN" for the best user experience (they load very quickly). Performance is a huge priority for sites built with the Jamstack - just like
FastComments.

#### Why FastComments Works With The Jamstack

FastComments only requires a small (< 11kb currently) code snippet at the bottom of the static page where you want to add comments. Therefore, installing FastComments on a typical
Jamstack site takes only a few seconds, just like any static site.

#### Potential Issues

We recognize that Jamstack sites don’t always start as something static. They may be developed with Preact, React, or Vue, for example. Written in vanilla JS, we created the FastComments widget
for maximum interoperability to work with all major frameworks. However, if you run into issues with FastComments and your preferred framework, then
<a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/help" target="_blank">let us know</a>.

#### In Conclusion

We hope that FastComments enables your users to engage with your site, provide feedback, and leave comments in ways that they normally couldn't on a static site.
For instance, this page is pre-rendered just like a traditional Jamstack site, and you can see FastComments happily functioning at the bottom.

Cheers!
