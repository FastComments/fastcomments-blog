### What's New

Today we released a series of bug fixes for image uploading and the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing mode.

1. Progress indication is now displayed when uploading images.
2. Pasting images, such as screenshots, is now supported (WYSIWYG editor only).
3. When editing comments, the comment boxes are now appropriately sized to display all the images (WYSIWYG editor only).
4. When removing images, the comment box shrinks as expected (WYSIWYG editor only). 

### In Conclusion

We appreciate our patient customers who highlighted some of these issues. We hope you
continue to enjoy using FastComments.
