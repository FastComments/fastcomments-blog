### What's New

FastComments now features a fully self-hosted affiliate program to enhance conversion rates and reliability.

### Previous Provider

FastComments previously operated its affiliate program through a provider called Rewardful. We became concerned about the conversion
rates associated with this program and realized that ad blockers were affecting this integration.

This is obviously a significant concern, as most people use an ad blocker nowadays.

According to Rewardful, the program was functioning properly, but to improve its performance, we could pay them more money. It was not unaffordable, but
we found their approach to handling this issue, which did not include the necessary features to ensure functionality across all tiers of their platform,
to be unacceptable. Therefore, we quickly canceled this partnership. Any FastComments customer data that was in Rewardful should now be deleted
at our request.

### The New Dashboard

When you view the affiliates dashboard for the first time, you will see this:

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="images/affiliates-dashboard.png" alt="Affiliates Dashboard" title="Affiliates Dashboard" />
</div>

Clicking Create Affiliate Link will guide you through the process of creating your link and specifying your PayPal email for payouts.

### Impact to Existing Affiliates

Existing affiliates have already been migrated to the new system. If you had an account, you can view your affiliate stats in the
[affiliates dashboard](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/affiliates). Payouts have resumed on the normal schedule.

### Benefits of Running it Ourselves

Now that we manage the affiliate program on our own tech stack, we no longer have to worry about ad blockers or other issues.

We can also offer much more detailed stats regarding conversions. Additionally, we can customize this reporting experience over time without relying
on another provider.

### Documentation

[You can find the full documentation here](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-affiliates.html)

### In Conclusion

Like all major releases, we're glad that we took the time to optimize, test, and properly launch this. Please let us know
below if you encounter any issues.

Cheers!
