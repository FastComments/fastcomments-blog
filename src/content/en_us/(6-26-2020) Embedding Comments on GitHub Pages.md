#### For Developers
Installing FastComments on a web page only requires inserting a small code snippet. This means it works on static pages seamlessly - including GitHub's free Pages hosting.

#### A Demo

We've set up an example GitHub Page <a href="https://fastcomments.github.io/fastcomments-demo.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<a href="https://github.com/fastcomments/fastcomments-demo.github.io/blob/master/index.html#L29" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link to where we've added the code snippet for our
testing account.

#### Setup

You'll need to add your GitHub domain as a valid domain in your account.

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="images/fc-github-pages-add-domain.png" alt="Add GitHub Domain in UI" title="Add Domain UI" class="lozad" />
</div>

#### In Conclusion

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/3sg.gif" alt="Kitty Jumping" title="Athletic Kitty" />
</div>

We hope you find FastComments quick and easy to use - cheers!
