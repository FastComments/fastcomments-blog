### What's New

This year we launched user profiles, and along with that, user karma. Until now, if a comment was deleted, the associated karma was lost. Not anymore!

Now, if a user receives up votes or down votes that impact their karma, deleting that comment will not result in those changes being lost.

### SSO

This update is also applicable to SSO users, who now have a new `karma` property available in the API.

### In Conclusion

We hope you find this update useful. Feel free to comment below with any questions.

Cheers!
