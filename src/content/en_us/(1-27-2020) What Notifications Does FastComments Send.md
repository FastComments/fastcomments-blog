Depending on how you use FastComments, you could receive two different types of notifications.

In today's world, notifications are everywhere. They're a hassle. FastComments doesn't want to add to that hassle, but if you run a site with FastComments installed, it should help you stay connected with your audience.

Also, if someone replies to you, you'd probably want to know.
But have you ever replied to a popular YouTube video and then received a flood of notifications for all the replies to your comment?

If you operate a site with FastComments installed, then you'll receive a notification **at most every hour** summarizing all your comments across all your pages.

If you're just someone commenting on a random cat picture on the internet and someone replies to you - you'll be notified **at most** every hour with a list of those replies.

But no matter who you are, you can easily opt out of all notifications from your account page by clicking the bell 🔔.
