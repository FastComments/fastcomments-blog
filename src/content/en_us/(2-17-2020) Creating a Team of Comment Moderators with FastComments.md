# [postlink]Creating a Team of Comment Moderators with FastComments[/postlink]

A one-person army only scales so far. What do you do when you're overwhelmed by the number of comments you need to review?

### The Problem

You have a lot of content, and a lot of comments. This is good - your user base is engaged enough to interact with you. But now you're overwhelmed
and need to scale your operation.

### FastComments Moderation

FastComments moderation tools provide an efficient environment for reviewing comments, marking them as spam, or (if necessary) deleting them.

The dashboard is also responsive, so you can review and moderate comments while on the move!

But access to moderating comments for your site is not limited to just your account. Someone can create their own FastComments account and be invited
to your site via the admin dashboard, [or in bulk via the API](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-api.html#moderator-structure). They don't even need to know about FastComments or create an account beforehand. The invite link that we'll show you
how to send will guide them through creating an account.

Simply log into your account and hover over Moderate Comments. You'll see an option to Manage Moderators.

If you haven't added any moderators yet, this button will take you to a wizard that will guide you through adding a moderator.

You'll just need to provide a name and email. They will automatically receive an invitation link which will also guide them through account creation.

Optionally, you can also place moderators and comments into separate groups. [Learn more about Moderation Groups and further moderation features here.](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-moderation.html)

If you have a team of moderators, you can see their progress from the same place - the Comment Moderators list provides stats for each moderator. This includes
the number of comments they've marked reviewed, spam, and deleted.

That's it. After you send that invite link they can create their account and will have full access to moderate your comments. They will only see a simplified
version of the Moderate Comments page - no ability to change settings is provided to moderators.

Happy commenting!
