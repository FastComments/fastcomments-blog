### What's New

FastComments can now be utilized to automatically schedule and play back comments over a period of time.

This is beneficial for webinars or other live events.

### How it Works

With Scheduled Comments, simply upload a CSV describing the comments you want to post. This CSV outlines where and when to post those
comments. Every comment can have its own username and avatar, and is posted **live**.

You can replay the same comment thread repeatedly, which is useful for things like webinars or training scenarios.

### How to Get It & Documentation

All customers on all tiers have access to Scheduled Comments. [You can find the documentation on Scheduled Comments here.](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-scheduled-comments.html).

You can find the [Scheduled Comments UI here](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/manage-data/import-scheduled).

### In Conclusion

Like all major releases, we're pleased that we could take the time to optimize, test, and properly release this feature. Let us know
below if you encounter any issues.

Cheers!
