# [postlink]FastComments Default Avatars Using Gravatar[/postlink]

### What's an Avatar?

An avatar is the profile icon associated with every account and displayed next to every comment.

### What's Gravatar?

<a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a> brands itself as "A Globally Recognized Avatar".
It's a service where you can define an avatar for a specific email. Any products you sign up for using that email can then
use that avatar. This simplifies the process for people signing up for FastComments since their avatar is set up automatically.

### So what's the change?

FastComments will now pull default avatars from Gravatar. You or your users don't have to do anything to take advantage of this feature.

If your existing users have already set their own avatar - no worries - we aren't going to overwrite their custom avatars.
Additionally, users can still replace the Gravatar avatar in FastComments.
