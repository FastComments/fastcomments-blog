# [postlink]How to Hide Your Comment Feed Under a Link[/postlink]

Don't want to display a comment feed at the end of your pages, but still want to allow users to comment? We've got you covered.

{{#isPost}}

## For Site Admins

To hide a comment feed for a specific page, or URL, under a link like "Show 103 Comments", simply create a customization rule like this:

<img 
    src="images/hide-comments-under-link.png"
    alt="Hide Comments Under Link Setting"
    class='lozad' />

This page has the setting applied as well.
Happy commenting!
