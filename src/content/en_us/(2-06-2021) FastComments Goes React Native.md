### <i class="circle">!</i> This Article Contains Technical Jargon

### What's New

FastComments now includes React Native components that are at feature parity with our VanillaJS widget.

We decided to name the library `fastcomments-react-native`. You can find the GitHub repository with the source code <a href="https://github.com/FastComments/fastcomments-react-native" target="_blank">here</a>.

The repository also includes example usage of the widget.

It's available on NPM, which you can find <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastcomments-react-native" target="_blank">here</a>.

### How it Works

The way this new component operates is that the React component serves as a wrapper around the existing FastComments widget.

This means if we add features to our existing components or fix bugs, you’ll still benefit right away!

### Development Time

The React Native widgets can be integrated into your application in just a few minutes with minimal development time required.

### SSO

All React Native libraries support SSO out of the box, and the SSO integration process is the same as for the Vanilla JS components. The existing backend code examples apply as well.

### Custom Styling?

The React Native components can be styled using CSS via the Widget Customization UI, just like the web-based widgets.

### Alternatives

You could create your own UI around

### In Conclusion

By releasing the `fastcomments-react-native` library, along with future libraries, we aim to make it easier for developers to adopt FastComments while utilizing modern development methodologies.

Cheers!
