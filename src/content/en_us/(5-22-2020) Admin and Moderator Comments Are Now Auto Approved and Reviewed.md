# [postlink]Admin and Moderator Comments Are Now Auto Approved and Reviewed[/postlink]

A minor announcement - but welcome to many!

{{#isPost}}

Previously, if auto approval was disabled, then comments made by administrators or moderators would still require approval. Additionally, they would be labeled "Not Reviewed."

With today's release, all moderator and administrator comments will be marked as Approved and Reviewed.

Happy commenting.
