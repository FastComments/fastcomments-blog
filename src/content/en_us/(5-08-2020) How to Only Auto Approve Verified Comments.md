# [postlink]How to Only Auto Approve Verified Comments[/postlink]

Do you have auto approval enabled but only want verified comments to appear on your site or blog?

{{#isPost}}

Here's how: Go to <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/settings" target="_blank">Moderate Comments -> Edit Moderation Settings</a>.

From there, check **Automatically Approve Comments** if it's not checked - then select **Only Auto Approve Verified Comments** and hit **save**.

<img 
    src="images/fc-verification-approves-comment.png"
    alt="The auto approve when verified option highlighted"
    title="The auto approve when verified option highlighted"
    class='lozad' />

Now any comment that isn't verified by email won't show until the commenter completes the verification. They will also see a friendly message when leaving their comment, reminding them to check their email.

Changing this setting takes effect immediately; however, it will not apply to past comments.

Happy commenting!
