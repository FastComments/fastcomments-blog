### What's New

With this update, you can now customize emails sent from FastComments to your customers.

The new email customization features utilize the powerful EJS template language, support custom CSS, HTML, and provide direct access to the data included in each email. Additionally, translations can be customized on a per-locale basis so that every user receives readable emails in their language.

The platform also includes features to track and report render errors to assist you in building a reliable integration. Find out more in the documentation.

### How to Get It & Documentation

The new email template customization dashboard is available via [Customize -> Email Templates](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/customize-email-templates).

Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-email-templates.html).

### In Conclusion

Like all major releases, we're pleased that we could take the time to optimize, test, and properly launch this feature. Let us know below if you encounter any issues.

Cheers!
