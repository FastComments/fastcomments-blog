### What's New

In the past, if you wanted to moderate comments, you could only do it from the Comment Moderation page.

Although this page included several optimizations to facilitate moderation, such as bulk actions, there are advantages 
to not having to leave your site. Specifically, moderators can easily see the context around each comment as they navigate 
through the comment threads. This also allows for editing comments **live** as they come in.

Now, you can moderate directly on your site using FastComments!

When logged in, moderators will see a small edit icon in the top right of each comment. Hovering over this will 
display a menu with some new options.

<div class="text-center">
    <img class="lozad" src="images/fc-moderate-comment-actions.png" alt="Comment Moderation Actions" title="Comment Moderation Actions" />
</div>

These options will also be visible in the Comment Thread Viewer.

### Documentation

You can find documentation detailing what moderation actions are available and how this affects live commenting <a href="https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-moderation.html#comment-actions-from-comment-widget" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Who Gets It

Customers on all tiers now have this feature activated.

### Performance Impact

The code and assets related to moderating in this way are only downloaded to the browsers of your moderators - it does not 
affect the page load times for visitors to your site.

### In Conclusion

We hope you find this makes your job as a moderator simpler.

Happy commenting!
