<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">RSS</a> is a way to subscribe to many different websites using a single news aggregator.

What this means is that you can now **monitor your comments on FastComments using an RSS app on your desktop or mobile device.**

#### How to Use It

You can now manage your RSS feed from the dedicated <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/rss" target="_blank">RSS Feed page</a> in your dashboard. Simply enable the feed, copy your unique RSS URL, and paste it into your favorite RSS aggregator.

The feed will include all comments from the last 30 days.

That’s all there is to it. Happy commenting!
