{{#unless isPost}}
This is a small feature launch that we believe will benefit some communities.

### What's New

FastComments by default displays your username exactly as you entered it. Similarly, if your username was provided to us via SSO, we'll show that. We do support
display **labels** to show alongside your username, but it does not replace your username.

Now, tenants can configure, on a site-wide or page-specific basis, how usernames will be displayed. For example, given the username "allen rex," we can instead
automatically format it like:

- Capitalize (display allen rex as Allen Rex)
- Last Initial (display Allen Rex as Allen R.)
- All Initials (display Allen Red as A. R.)
- Show "Anonymous"

### Documentation

This can be set up via the Customize page in your admin dashboard.

[Documentation can also be found here](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#user-name-formats)

### In Conclusion

We appreciate our customers who provide continuous feedback so that we can come up with ideas like this. We hope you
continue to enjoy FastComments.

Cheers!
