### What's New

FastComments now offers support for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), adding an extra layer of security for your account.

You can now secure your FastComments account using either SMS verification or authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or any TOTP-compatible application.

### How to Enable 2FA

There is a new "Two-Factor Authentication" button on the Account Details page. The direct link is https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/two-factor.

### Multiple Device Support

Understanding that users often work across multiple devices, FastComments allows you to register multiple authenticator apps to your account. This means you can have the authenticator set up on both your phone and tablet, etc., up to five authenticators.

### In Conclusion

Security is a top priority for FastComments, and we're dedicated to providing our users with the tools they need to keep their accounts secure. Two-Factor Authentication is now available to all users at no additional cost.

We thank our customers for their ongoing feedback and trust. We hope you continue to enjoy FastComments.

Cheers!
