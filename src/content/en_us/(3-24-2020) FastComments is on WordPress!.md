Thinking about switching from another WordPress comment plugin? Give FastComments a try!

{{#isPost}}

We're excited to announce that, after a lot of effort, we've launched our WordPress plugin. You can find it here:
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fastcomments/" target="_blank">https://wordpress.org/plugins/fastcomments/</a>.

We've discovered that FastComments performs significantly better than the default WordPress comments, particularly for larger comment threads.

It will speed up your WordPress site by reducing the load on your server - since we will render the comment threads instead of WordPress.

The benchmarks speak for themselves - at 100 comments on a post running on a server with no load, a standard WordPress install can handle 86 requests a second before it crashes.

With FastComments enabled, that number increases to **over 400**.

We hope users find the plugin to be easy to use, customizable, and overall "just works." It should effortlessly sync your WordPress comments back and forth as well without putting strain on your servers.
