### What's New

[FastComments Analytics](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/analytics) can now generate a **live** report on users
engaging with your platform or product.

A total number of users online is provided, along with the ability to **sort pages by the number of users online**. You can also sort pages
by the number of comments on each page.

You’ll find these reports are accurate and fast, as we have put significant effort into ensuring they
function as such so that FastComments can continue to live up to its name. :)

### How to Get It

All FastComments customers across all tiers now have access to the new live analytics data via the [FastComments Analytics page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/analytics).

### Metrics Accuracy

The live metrics (users online, users online per page) are reported in real-time. They do require a page refresh to see the latest number, but
that number is served without any caching or delay. The other metrics, like number of page loads or new comments per day, may have a delay of up to one minute.

### User Activity Icon Improvements

Along with this release, we have enhanced the accuracy of the user activity icons displayed on each comment that indicate whether a user
is online and viewing that comment thread. Previously, there could be some delay, or the icon may not have always been accurate. This has been
improved with a complete rewrite of the user activity tracking system.

### Documentation

Updated analytics documentation can be found on [docs.fastcomments.com](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-analytics.html).

### In Conclusion

Like all major releases, we’re pleased that we could take the time to optimize, test, and properly launch this feature. Let us know
below if you encounter any issues.

Cheers!
