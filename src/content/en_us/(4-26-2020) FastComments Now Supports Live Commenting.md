FastComments is now not only fast – it’s real-time! Chat and interact just like a social network with our easily embeddable widget.

We understand that our existing customers appreciate how unobtrusive FastComments is – and we’ve maintained that quality. To add real-time capabilities, we increased
the download size of the widget by less than 1kb. To make things even better, we have not added any popups or login requirements for the real-time comments to function – anyone
can see the votes and comments change in real-time.

It would be quite frustrating if the page size changes while the user is trying to interact with your content. There’s nothing worse than attempting to read or click
something, only to have the content shift.

FastComments notifies the user using unobtrusive inline buttons in the widget regarding how many new comments have been posted for the page, or if there are replies to any comments. The user must click to view the new
replies – thus eliminating any disorienting shifts in content. Comment karma will automatically update without any interaction; however, the sorting order will be preserved for readability.

Here’s a short video showing it in action.

We hope you and your users find it enjoyable to use, cheers!
