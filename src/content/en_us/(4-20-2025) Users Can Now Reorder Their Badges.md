{{#unless isPost}}
Have dozens of badges and want to customize the order in which they appear? Don’t worry.

### What's New
A long-standing request from power users of FastComments has been the ability to reorder their badges. Users can be automatically awarded badges, and some sites have many different types. When displaying 20 different badges on each comment, with some being image badges and others being text, showing them in the awarded order is not always ideal.

Now, by hovering over your account name in the top right of your dashboard and selecting `Manage Badges`, you can choose which badges are active as well as reorder them. New badges will still be added at the end.

### In The Future

In the future, we will be revamping the user profile UI, and the new reorder component will replace the existing "Select Badges to Show" UI in profiles.

### In Conclusion

Like all major releases, we’re pleased that we could take the time to optimize, test, and properly roll out this feature. Let us know below if you encounter any issues.

Cheers!
