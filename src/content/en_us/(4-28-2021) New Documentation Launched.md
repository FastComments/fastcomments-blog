# [postlink]New Documentation Launched[/postlink]

{{#unless isPost}}
We’ve launched a site just for our documentation.

## What’s New

Until now, our blog served a dual purpose as both documentation and news updates.

No more!

## The Documentation Site

You can find our new documentation site at [docs.fastcomments.com](https://docs.fastcomments.com).

## The Future of This Blog

We’ll still post updates, and some documentation to this blog; however, it will not have the same depth as the documentation
hosted on [docs.fastcomments.com](https://docs.fastcomments.com).

## Feedback

If you discover any gaps in our documentation, please let us know by commenting on that page.

## Contributing

The documentation repo is available on GitHub; check it out here: https://github.com/FastComments/fastcomments-docs

While we welcome contributions, we’d appreciate it if you could file an issue first to prevent anyone from duplicating your work.

## In Conclusion

We’ve put months of love into the new documentation site - the framework itself, and the content - and we hope
the community finds it useful.
