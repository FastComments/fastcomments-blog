<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">RSS</a> is a way to subscribe to many different websites using a single news aggregator.

What this means is that you can now **monitor your comments on FastComments using an RSS app on your desktop or mobile phone.**

#### How to Use It

On the <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments" target="_blank">Moderate Comments</a> page of the admin dashboard there is now an RSS feed icon at the bottom.

This icon goes to a link - which is your very own RSS feed! Simply copy and paste this link into your favorite RSS aggregator.

The feed will include all comments in the last 30 days.

That's all there is too it. Happy commenting!
