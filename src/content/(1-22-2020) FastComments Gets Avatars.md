# FastComments Gets Avatars [postlink]

After launch this was the most asked for feature, so here it is.

If you are logged in and comment, or view your existing comments, you'll see there is now an empty profile picture next to your name.

{{#isPost}}
This is clickable and will take you to your account where you can configure an Avatar.
Avatars are resized to 40x40 pixels and we accept JPGs and PNGs.

Once you configure an avatar all your past comments will be updated.

Also, we are forgiving and won't waste your bandwidth. Avatars are not fetched unless they come into view.
