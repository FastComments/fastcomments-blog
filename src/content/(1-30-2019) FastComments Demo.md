# FastComments Demo [postlink]

This article is just a demo of FastComments. The comment thread at the bottom is a live version of the service.

Leave a comment, or vote on a few comments. Maybe share some cat pictures.

If you leave a comment and don't verify it via email within three days it'll automatically be removed. This is one of FastComment's
powers to fight spam.

It may not look impressive, but that's its job. FastComments should get out of the way of your users and let the engage with you. So the less impact the better.
