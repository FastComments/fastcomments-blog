#### For Developers
Installing FastComments on a web page only requires inserting a small code snippet. This means it works on static pages without any fuss - including GitHub's free Pages hosting.

#### A Demo

We've setup an example GitHub Page <a href="https://blog.fastcomments.com/(12-30-2019)-fastcomments-demo.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<a href="https://github.com/fastcomments/fastcomments-demo.github.io/blob/master/index.html#L29" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link to where we've added the code snippet for our
testing account.

#### Setup

You'll have to add your GitHub domain as a valid domain in your account. No worries though, all FastComments tiers currently have unlimited domains and are only limited by traffic.

<div class="text-center">
    <img data-src="images/fc-github-pages-add-domain.png" alt="Add GitHub Domain in UI" title="Add Domain UI" class="lozad" />
</div>

#### In Conclusion

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/3sg.gif" alt="Kitty Jumping" title="Athletic Kitty" />
</div>

We hope you find FastComments fast and easy to use - cheers!
