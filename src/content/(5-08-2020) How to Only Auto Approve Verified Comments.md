# [postlink]How to Only Auto Approve Verified Comments[/postlink]

Have auto approval enabled but only want verified comments to show on your site or blog?

{{#isPost}}

Here's how: Go to <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/settings">Moderate Comments -> Edit Moderation Settings</a>.

From there, check "Automatically Approve Comments" if it's not checked - then "Only Auto Approve Verified Comments" and hit save.

<img 
    data-src="images/fc-verification-approves-comment.png"
    alt="The auto approve when verified option highlighted"
    title="The auto approve when verified option highlighted"
    class='lozad' />

Now any comment that's not verified by email won't show until the commenter verifies it. They'll also be shown a friendly message
when leaving their comment that they should check their email.

Changing this setting is immediate, however it will not apply for past comments.

Happy commenting!
